*I﻿nvestigating - We are aware that US Midwest cannot reached today, and we are trying to understand the cause of why it happened. Further information will be shared later on.*

*R﻿esolved - Seams like this issue was due a random power outage that occurred last night. We are not sure on why this happened, but we believe it was due to the storms that pushed into the area. We were not aware of this, so we are trying to look more into that later on. Thank you for your patience!*
